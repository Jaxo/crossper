git checkout -b Vidal   # created my own branch.  sufgest you do the same
</Commands>

OK: the code confirms it.  Those are newbies of the pure species.
Need ZXing.  They use deprecated 2.1.
(a crude download is much easier than a true build, hey?)
I use 2.3.  Requires Maven.

Read:
http://code.google.com/p/zxing/wiki/GettingStarted

<Commands>
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/zxing/zxing.git
cd zxing
~/android-sdks/tools/android update project --path android
cd core
# create ~/zxing/core/target/core-2.3-SNAPSHOT.jar
mvn -DskipTests -Dgpg.skip=true install
</Commands>

But we don't need all the core!  PDF417, Aztec?  Later.
Open Eclipse, Create android project from existing code,
Path ~/crossper/Mobile/Crossper_Android/Crossper
=> Project 'Crossper' is missing required library:
   '/Users/shyamgosavi/Documents/Projects/zxing-2.1/core/core.jar'
Running Windoze + hardcoded path, Mr Shyamgosavi.  Clever!
No time for symlinks or submodules...

<Commands>
cp ~/zxing/core/target/core-2.3-SNAPSHOT.jar ~/crossper/Mobile/Crossper_Android/Crossper/libs
</Commands>
and modify eclipse Properties->Java Build Path -> suppress the dangling, add external jars...

408 warnings!  Thanks Sean.
But, hmmm,  what?  408 warnings in **ZXing**?
Mamma mia: they copied the Zxing source!
And they have all bin checked in Bitbucket.  Youppiiiiiiiiiiie!
<Commands>
rm -rf /crossper/Mobile/Crossper_Android/Crossper/src/com/google
rm -rf /crossper/Mobile/Crossper_Android/Crossper/bin
</Commands>

Noon. I was able to run the Android Simulator.
Evening:
Trying to push my branch...  Created the SSH key, etc, etc.
No success b/c this BitBucket is read-only.
Well: use our good'ol github.  That is:
